I made this while trying to naildown using CSS3's flexbox and writing out the output of a JS switch statement to a HTML document.  At some point I realized there was no input sanitation in either this or the larger project I'm working on (GenderGame!) and threw in some regex -- but I don't think I have it 100% down yet.   I'm also still trying to figure out the playability of keeping the interactive fiction I'm writing as a browser document text game (probably not -- its not enjoyable) or if I want to inevitably try for some sort of console based display or maybe even try at graphics...

...UI is not my strong point.

When I posted this to a few friends, I got wailed on for there only being three colors that'd...pass...and the bizzaro-outputs.  Proving that everyone took this more seriously than I ever would.

In the future I might add:
More ways for the switch statement to throw something other than the default.
Hexadecimal color recognition.  Maybe.
